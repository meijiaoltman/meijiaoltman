**About Me:** 

Nice to meet you! I am currently a fourth-year Honors student at the University of Denver. I am majoring in Business Information & Analytics in the Daniels College of Business at the University of Denver. I have also completed minors in Spanish and Accounting. I have always been good with numbers, but my passion for business analytics stems from the story these numbers can tell. I am excited to transform data into dynamic dashboards, simulations, models, and visuals to help individuals and businesses make informed and beneficial decisions. As an engaged student on campus, I have utilized my skills and knowledge to fulfill fundraising goals as Fundraising Chair for Club Women’s Water Polo, maintain a constantly up to date website as Webmaster for Delta Sigma Pi, and exceed donation goals as a Student Caller at the Crimson Call Center.


In my experience, I have seen how analyzed data can transform idealized objectives into measurable steps. As I continue pursuing my degree at the University of Denver, I am excited to gain more exposure in different coding languages and master complex data simulations so I can understand and interpret the data required to make a business recommendation.
